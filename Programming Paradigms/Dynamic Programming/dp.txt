Goal: 
Solve only subproblems that are necessary and solve it only once

Memorization is another way to deal with overlapping subproblems in dynamic programming

With memorization, we implement the algorithm recursively:
If we encounter a new subproblem, we compute and store the solution.
If we encounter a subproblem we have seen, we look up the answer

Most useful when the algorithm is easiest to implement recursively
Especially if we do not need solutions to all subproblems.
